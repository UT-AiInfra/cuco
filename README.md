# CUCo: An Agentic Framework for Compute and Communication Co-design

**[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.02376)**

CUCo is a training-free, agent-driven framework that automatically generates high-performance CUDA kernels jointly orchestrating computation and communication. By co-optimizing these traditionally disjoint components, CUCo unlocks optimization opportunities unavailable to existing approaches, reducing end-to-end latency by up to 1.57x over host-driven baselines.

## Overview

CUCo consists of three inter-twined components:

1. **Design Space Specification** — A structured, declarative set of communication primitives (backend, placement, sync scope, issuer granularity, chunk size) that grounds agent reasoning in valid collective semantics.

2. **Fast-Path Agent** — A correctness-first pipeline that converts host-driven NCCL code into device-initiated (GIN/LSA) equivalents through a three-step process: CUDA code analysis, host-to-device transformation via an LLM-judge loop, and evolve-block annotation.

3. **Slow-Path Agent** — An LLM-driven evolutionary search that optimizes the fast-path baseline through island-based populations, phase-dependent explore/exploit mutation, cascaded evaluation, and a shared candidate database with meta-summarization.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10
- CUDA 13.1+ with NCCL 2.28.9+ (for device-initiated communication)
- NVIDIA GPUs with NVLink (intra-node) or RoCE (inter-node)
- LLM API credentials (Anthropic Bedrock, OpenAI, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UT-AiInfra/cuco.git
cd cuco

# Create virtual environment and install
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the repository root with your LLM API credentials:

```bash
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
```

## Usage

### Fast-Path Agent (Host-to-Device Transformation)

The fast-path agent converts a host-driven NCCL program into a device-initiated equivalent:

```bash
cd examples/ds_v3_moe
python run_transform.py
```

This runs the three-step pipeline (CUDA analysis, host-to-device transformation, evolve-block annotation) and outputs the transformed kernel to `_transform_host_output/`.

### Slow-Path Agent (Evolutionary Search)

The slow-path agent optimizes the transformed kernel through LLM-driven evolution:

```bash
cd examples/ds_v3_moe
python run_evo.py --num_generations=18
```

Evolution results (candidate programs, scores, logs) are saved to `results_ds_v3_moe/`.

### Visualization

Launch the interactive web UI to explore the evolution tree:

```bash
cuco_visualize --db examples/ds_v3_moe/results_ds_v3_moe/evolution_db.sqlite
```
